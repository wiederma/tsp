wait_where_is_this_place
========================

Some scripting with Python, AJAX, JSON using the google maps API to show a list of places on a map to illustrate distances

In order to get my scripts running, you need to have a webserver like apache2 installed:
sudo apt-get install apache2

To keep it simple, navigate to /var/www/ and run "git clone" there
then open a web browser and navigate to localhost/wait_where_is_this_place
and you should see a google maps of Munich presenting the public swimming pools
managed by the local municipal works (SWM)

enjoy :D
