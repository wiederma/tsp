========================

Some scripting with Python, AJAX, JSON using the google maps API to show a list of places on a map to illustrate distances

In order to get my scripts running, you need to have a webserver to provide the html files and handle the XMLHttpRequest stuff.

To keep it simple, git clone the repository to some folder and start a python based webserver:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Now, use your browser and open localhost:8000, click on baeder.html and you should see a google map of Munich presenting the public swimming pools managed by the local municipal works (SWM)

enjoy :D
